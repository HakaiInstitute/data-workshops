## Data Manipulation using **`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`**

Bracket subsetting is handy, but it can be cumbersome and difficult to read,
especially for complicated operations. Enter **`dplyr`**. **`dplyr`** is a package for
making tabular data manipulation easier. It pairs nicely with **`tidyr`** which enables you to swiftly convert between different data formats for plotting and analysis.

Packages in R are basically sets of additional functions that let you do more
stuff. The functions we've been using so far, like `str()` or `data.frame()`,
come built into R; packages give you access to more of them. Before you use a
package for the first time you need to install it on your machine, and then you
should import it in every subsequent R session when you need it. You should
already have installed the **`tidyverse`** package. This is an
"umbrella-package" that installs several packages useful for data analysis which
work together well such as **`tidyr`**, **`dplyr`**, **`ggplot2`**, **`tibble`**, etc.

To load the package type:

```{r, message = FALSE, purl = FALSE}
## load the tidyverse packages, incl. dplyr
library("tidyverse")
```

## What are **`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`**?

The package **`dplyr`** provides easy tools for the most common data manipulation
tasks. It is built to work directly with data frames, with many common tasks
optimized by being written in a compiled language (C++). An additional feature is the
ability to work directly with data stored in an external database. The benefits of
doing this are that the data can be managed natively in a relational database,
queries can be conducted on that database, and only the results of the query are
returned.

This addresses a common problem with R in that all operations are conducted
in-memory and thus the amount of data you can work with is limited by available
memory. The database connections essentially remove that limitation in that you
can connect to a database of many hundreds of GB, conduct queries on it directly, and pull
back into R only what you need for analysis.

The package **`tidyr`** addresses the common problem of wanting to reshape your data for plotting and use by different R functions. Sometimes we want data sets where we have one row per measurement. Sometimes we want a data frame where each measurement type has its own column, and rows are instead more aggregated groups - like plots or aquaria. Moving back and forth between these formats is nontrivial, and **`tidyr`** gives you tools for this and more sophisticated  data manipulation.

To learn more about **`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`** after the workshop, you may want to check out this
[handy data transformation with **`dplyr`** cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-transformation.pdf) and this [one about **`tidyr`**](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-import.pdf).


```{r, results = 'hide', purl = FALSE}
surveys <- read_csv("data/portal_data_joined.csv")

## inspect the data
str(surveys)

## preview the data
# View(surveys)
```

We're going to learn some of the most common **`dplyr`** functions:

- `select()`: subset columns
- `filter()`: subset rows on conditions
- `mutate()`: create new columns by using information from other columns
- `group_by()` and `summarize()`: create summary statisitcs on grouped data
- `arrange()`: sort results
- `count()`: count discrete values

## Selecting columns and filtering rows

To select columns of a data frame, use `select()`. The first argument
to this function is the data frame (`surveys`), and the subsequent
arguments are the columns to keep.

```{r, results = 'hide', purl = FALSE}
select(surveys, plot_id, species_id, weight)
```

To select all columns *except* certain ones, put a "-" in front of
the variable to exclude it.

```{r, results = 'hide', purl = FALSE}
select(surveys, -record_id, -species_id)
```

This will select all the variables in `surveys` except `record_id`
and `species_id`.

To choose rows based on a specific criteria, use `filter()`:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
filter(surveys, year == 1995)
```

## Pipes

What if you want to select and filter at the same time? There are three
ways to do this: use intermediate steps, nested functions, or pipes.

With intermediate steps, you create a temporary data frame and use
that as input to the next function, like this:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys2 <- filter(surveys, weight < 5)
surveys_sml <- select(surveys2, species_id, sex, weight)
```

This is readable, but can clutter up your workspace with lots of objects that you have to name individually. With multiple steps, that can be hard to keep track of.

You can also nest functions (i.e. one function inside of another), like this:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys_sml <- select(filter(surveys, weight < 5), species_id, sex, weight)
```

This is handy, but can be difficult to read if too many functions are nested, as
R evaluates the expression from the inside out (in this case, filtering, then selecting).

The last option, *pipes*, are a recent addition to R. Pipes let you take
the output of one function and send it directly to the next, which is useful
when you need to do many things to the same dataset.  Pipes in R look like
`%>%` and are made available via the **`magrittr`** package, installed automatically
with **`dplyr`**. If you use RStudio, you can type the pipe with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>
+ <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> if you have a PC or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + 
<kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> if you have a Mac.

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  filter(weight < 5) %>%
  select(species_id, sex, weight)
```

In the above code, we use the pipe to send the `surveys` dataset first through
`filter()` to keep rows where `weight` is less than 5, then through `select()`
to keep only the `species_id`, `sex`, and `weight` columns. Since `%>%` takes
the object on its left and passes it as the first argument to the function on
its right, we don't need to explicitly include the data frame as an argument
to the `filter()` and `select()` functions any more.

Some may find it helpful to read the pipe like the word "then". For instance,
in the above example, we took the data frame `surveys`, *then* we `filter`ed
for rows with `weight < 5`, *then* we `select`ed columns `species_id`, `sex`,
and `weight`. The **`dplyr`** functions by themselves are somewhat simple,
but by combining them into linear workflows with the pipe, we can accomplish
more complex manipulations of data frames.

If we want to create a new object with this smaller version of the data, we
can assign it a new name:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys_sml <- surveys %>%
  filter(weight < 5) %>%
  select(species_id, sex, weight)

surveys_sml
```

Note that the final data frame is the leftmost part of this expression.

## Pipes Challenge:
##  Using pipes, subset the data to include animals collected
##  before 1995, and retain the columns `year`, `sex`, and `weight.`
```

### Mutate

Frequently you'll want to create new columns based on the values in existing
columns, for example to do unit conversions, or to find the ratio of values in two
columns. For this we'll use `mutate()`.

To create a new column of weight in kg:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000)
```

You can also create a second new column based on the first new column within the same call of `mutate()`:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000,
         weight_kg2 = weight_kg * 2)
```

If this runs off your screen and you just want to see the first few rows, you
can use a pipe to view the `head()` of the data. (Pipes work with non-**`dplyr`**
functions, too, as long as the **`dplyr`** or `magrittr` package is loaded).

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000) %>%
  head()
```

The first few rows of the output are full of `NA`s, so if we wanted to remove
those we could insert a `filter()` in the chain:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000) %>%
  head()
```

`is.na()` is a function that determines whether something is an `NA`. The `!`
symbol negates the result, so we're asking for every row where weight *is not* an `NA`.

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
## Mutate Challenge:
##  Create a new data frame from the `surveys` data that meets the following
##  criteria: contains only the `species_id` column and a column that
##  contains values that are half the `hindfoot_length` values (e.g. a
##  new column `hindfoot_half`). In this `hindfoot_half` column, there are
##  no NA values and all values are < 30.

##  Hint: think about how the commands should be ordered to produce this data frame!
```

### The `summarize()` function

`group_by()` is often used together with `summarize()`, which collapses each
group into a single-row summary of that group.  `group_by()` takes as arguments
the column names that contain the **categorical** variables for which you want
to calculate the summary statistics. So to compute the mean `weight` by sex:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE))
```

You may also have noticed that the output from these calls doesn't run off the
screen anymore. It's one of the advantages of `tbl_df` over data frame.

You can also group by multiple columns:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE))
```

When grouping both by `sex` and `species_id`, the last few rows are for animals
that escaped before their sex and body weights could be determined. You may notice
that the last column does not contain `NA` but `NaN` (which refers to "Not a
Number"). To avoid this, we can remove the missing values for weight before we
attempt to calculate the summary statistics on weight. Because the missing
values are removed first, we can omit `na.rm = TRUE` when computing the mean:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight))
```

Here, again, the output from these calls doesn't run off the screen
anymore. If you want to display more data, you can use the `print()` function
at the end of your chain with the argument `n` specifying the number of rows to
display:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight)) %>%
  print(n = 15)
```

Once the data are grouped, you can also summarize multiple variables at the same
time (and not necessarily on the same variable). For instance, we could add a
column indicating the minimum weight for each species for each sex:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight),
            min_weight = min(weight))
```

It is sometimes useful to rearrange the result of a query to inspect the values. For instance, we can sort on `min_weight` to put the lighter species first:


```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight),
            min_weight = min(weight)) %>%
  arrange(min_weight)
```

To sort in descending order, we need to add the `desc()` function. If we want to sort the results by decreasing order of mean weight:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight),
            min_weight = min(weight)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_weight))
```


### Counting

When working with data, we often want to know the number of observations found
for each factor or combination of factors. For this task, **`dplyr`** provides
`count()`. For example, if we wanted to count the number of rows of data for
each sex, we would do:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
    count(sex) 
```

The `count()` function is shorthand for something we've already seen: grouping by a variable, and summarizing it by counting the number of observations in that group. In other words, `surveys %>% count()` is equivalent to:  

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
    group_by(sex) %>%
    summarise(count = n())
```

For convenience, `count()` provides the `sort` argument:  

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
    count(sex, sort = TRUE) 
```

## Count Challenges:
##  1. How many animals were caught in each `plot_type` surveyed?

##  2. Use `group_by()` and `summarize()` to find the mean, min, and max

```

### Reshaping with gather and spread

In the [spreadsheet
lesson](http://www.datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/01-format-data/),
we discussed how to structure our data leading to the four rules defining a tidy
dataset:

1. Each variable has its own column
2. Each observation has its own row
3. Each value must have its own cell
4. Each type of observational unit forms a table

Sometimes your you want to spread the observations of on variable across multiple columns.

#### Spreading

`spread()` takes three principal arguments:

1. the data 
2. the *key* column variable whose values will become new column names.  
3. the *value* column variable whose values will fill the new column variables.

Further arguments include `fill` which, if set, fills in missing values with 
the value provided.

Let's use `spread()` to transform surveys to find the mean weight of each 
species in each plot over the entire survey period. We use `filter()`,
`group_by()` and `summarise()` to filter our observations and variables of 
interest, and create a new variable for the `mean_weight`. We use the pipe as 
before too.

```{r, purl=FALSE}
surveys_gw <- surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(genus, plot_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight))

str(surveys_gw)
```

This yields `surveys_gw` where the observations for each plot are spread across
multiple rows, 196 observations of 3 variables. 
Using `spread()` to key on `genus` with values from `mean_weight` this becomes
24 observations of 11 variables, one row for each plot. We again use pipes:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
surveys_spread <- surveys_gw %>%
  spread(key = genus, value = mean_weight)

str(surveys_spread)
```

![](img/spread_data_R.png)

We could now plot comparisons between the weight of species in different plots, 
although we may wish to fill in the missing values first.

```{r, purl=FALSE}
surveys_gw %>%
  spread(genus, mean_weight, fill = 0) %>%
  head()
```

#### Gathering

The opposing situation could occur if we had been provided with data in the
form of `surveys_spread`, where the genus names are column names, but we 
wish to treat them as values of a genus variable instead.

In this situation we are gathering the column names and turning them into a
pair of new variables. One variable represents the column names as values, and
the other variable contains the values previously associated with the column names.

`gather()` takes four principal arguments:

1. the data
2. the *key* column variable we wish to create from column names.
3. the *values* column variable we wish to create and fill with values 
associated with the key.
4. the names of the columns we use to fill the key variable (or to drop).

To recreate `surveys_gw` from `surveys_spread` we would create a key called
`genus` and value called `mean_weight` and use all columns except `plot_id` for
the key variable. Here we drop `plot_id` column with a minus sign.

```{r, purl=FALSE}
surveys_gather <- surveys_spread %>%
  gather(key = genus, value = mean_weight, -plot_id)

str(surveys_gather)
```

![](img/gather_data_R.png)

Note that now the `NA` genera are included in the re-gathered format. Spreading
and then gathering can be a useful way to balance out a dataset so every
replicate has the same composition.

We could also have used a specification for what columns to include. This can be
useful if you have a large number of identifying columns, and it's easier to
specify what to gather than what to leave alone. And if the columns are in a
row, we don't even need to list them all out - just use the `:` operator!

```{r, purl=FALSE}
surveys_spread %>%
  gather(key = genus, value = mean_weight, Baiomys:Spermophilus) %>%
  head()
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
## Reshaping challenges

## 1. Make a wide data frame with `year` as columns, `plot_id`` as rows, and where the values are the number of genera per plot. You will need to summarize before reshaping, and use the function `n_distinct` to get the number of unique genera within a chunk of data. It's a powerful function! See `?n_distinct` for more.

## 2. Now take that data frame, and make it long again, so each row is a unique `plot_id` `year` combination

## 3. The `surveys` data set is not truly wide or long because there are two columns of measurement - `hindfoot_length` and `weight`.  This makes it difficult to do things like look at the relationship between mean values of each measurement per year in different plot types. Let's walk through a common solution for this type of problem. First, use `gather` to create a truly long dataset where we have a key column called `measurement` and a `value` column that takes on the value of either `hindfoot_length` or `weight`. Hint: You'll need to specify which columns are being gathered.

## 4. With this new truly long data set, calculate the average of each `measurement` in each `year` for each different `plot_type`. Then `spread` them into a wide data set with a column for `hindfoot_length` and `weight`. Hint: Remember, you only need to specify the key and value columns for `spread`.

```

## Exporting data

Now that you have learned how to use **`dplyr`** to extract information from
or summarize your raw data, you may want to export these new data sets to share
them with your collaborators or for archival.

Similar to the `read_csv()` function used for reading CSV files into R, there is
a `write_csv()` function that generates CSV files from data frames.

```{r}
write_csv(surveys_spread, "data/surveys_spread.csv")
```


## Factors

This section is from Jenny Bryan's course at UBC: Stat 545 

Factors are the variable type that useRs love to hate. It is how we store truly categorical information in R. The values a factor can take on are called the levels. In general, the levels are friendly human-readable character strings, like “male/female” and “control/treated”. But never ever ever forget that, under the hood, R is really storing integer codes 1, 2, 3, etc.

This Janus-like nature of factors means they are rich with booby traps for the unsuspecting but they are a necessary evil. I recommend you learn how to be the boss of your factors. The pros far outweigh the cons. Specifically in modelling and figure-making, factors are anticipated and accommodated by the functions and packages you will want to exploit.

The worst kind of factor is the stealth factor. The variable that you think of as character, but that is actually a factor (numeric!!). This is a classic R gotcha. Check your variable types explicitly when things seem weird. It happens to the best of us.

Where do stealth factors come from? Base R has a burning desire to turn character information into factor. The happens most commonly at data import via read.csv() and friends. But data.frame() and other functions are also eager to convert character to factor. To shut this down, use stringsAsFactors = FALSE in read.csv() and data.frame() or – even better – use the tidyverse! For data import, use  readr::read_csv(), readr::read_tsv(), etc. For data frame creation, use tibble::tibble(). And so on.

See for yourself the difference in how strings are treated with the two different 
methods of reading a csv file.

```{r}

surveys. <- read.csv("data/surveys.csv")
surveys_ <- read_csv("data/surveys.csv")

str(surveys.)
str(surveys_)
```

### The forcats Package

forcats is a core package in the tidyverse. It is installed via `install.packages("tidyverse")` and attached via `library(tidyverse)`. You can always load it individually via `library(forcats)`. Main functions start with fct_. There really is no coherent family of base functions that forcats replaces – that’s why it’s such a welcome addition.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(forcats)


library(gapminder)

```

Get to know your factor before you start touching it! It’s polite. Let’s use gapminder$continent as our example.

```{r}
str(gapminder$continent)
levels(gapminder$continent)
nlevels(gapminder$continent)
class(gapminder$continent)
```

To get a frequency table as a tibble, from a tibble, use dplyr::count(). To get similar from a free-range factor, use forcats::fct_count().

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  count(continent)

fct_count(gapminder$continent)
```

#### Dropping unused levels:

Just because you drop all the rows corresponding to a specific factor level, the levels of the factor itself do not change. Sometimes all these unused levels can come back to haunt you later, e.g., in figure legends.

Watch what happens to the levels of country (= nothing) when we filter Gapminder to a handful of countries.

```{r}
nlevels(gapminder$country)

h_countries <- c("Egypt", "Haiti", "Romania", "Thailand", "Venezuela")

h_gap <- gapminder %>%
  filter(country %in% h_countries)

nlevels(h_gap$country)
```

Even though `h_gap` only has data for a handful of countries, we are still schlepping around all 142 levels from the original gapminder tibble.

How can you get rid of them? The base function `droplevels()` operates on all the factors in a data frame or on a single factor. The function `forcats::fct_drop()` operates on a factor.

```{r}
h_gap_dropped <- h_gap %>% 
  droplevels()
nlevels(h_gap_dropped$country)

h_gap$country %>%
  fct_drop() %>%
  levels()
```

#### Change order of the levels, principled

By default, factor levels are ordered alphabetically. Which might as well be random, when you think about it! It is preferable to order the levels according to some principle:

* Frequency.Make the most common level the first and so on.
* Another variable. Order factor levels according to a summary statistic for another variable. Example: order Gapminder countries by life expectancy.

First, let’s order continent by frequency, forwards and backwards. This is often a great idea for tables and figures, esp. frequency barplots.

```{r}
## default order is alphabetical
gapminder$continent %>%
  levels()

## order by frequency
gapminder$continent %>% 
  fct_infreq() %>%
  levels()

## backwards!
gapminder$continent %>% 
  fct_infreq() %>%
  fct_rev() %>% 
  levels()

## order countries by median life expectancy
fct_reorder(gapminder$country, gapminder$lifeExp) %>% 
  levels() %>% head()
```


#### Change order of the levels, “because I said so”

Sometimes you just want to hoist one or more levels to the front. Why? Because I said so. 

```{r}
h_gap$country %>% levels()

h_gap$country %>% fct_relevel("Romania", "Haiti") %>% levels()
```

This might be useful if you are preparing a report for, say, the Romanian government. The reason for always putting Romania first has nothing to do with the data, it is important for external reasons and you need a way to express this.

#### Recode the levels

Sometimes you have better ideas about what certain levels should be. This is called recoding.

```{r}
i_gap <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(country %in% c("United States", "Sweden", "Australia")) %>% 
  droplevels()

i_gap$country %>% levels()

i_gap$country %>%
  fct_recode("USA" = "United States", "Oz" = "Australia") %>% levels()
```

Exercise: Isolate the data for "Australia", "Korea, Dem. Rep.", and "Korea, Rep." in the 2000x. Revalue the country factor levels to "Oz", "North Korea", and "South Korea".
